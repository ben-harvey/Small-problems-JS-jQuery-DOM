// Your task is to sort a given string. Each word in the string will contain a single number. This number is the position the word should have in the result.

// Note: Numbers can be from 1 to 9. So 1 will be the first word (not 0).

// If the input string is empty, return an empty string. The words in the input String will only contain valid consecutive numbers.

// Examples
// "is2 Thi1s T4est 3a"  -->  "Thi1s is2 3a T4est"
// "4of Fo1r pe6ople g3ood th5e the2"  -->  "Fo1r the2 g3ood 4of th5e pe6ople"
// ""  -->  ""

// The maximum sum subarray problem consists in finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subsequence in an array or list of integers:

// maxSequence([-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4])
// // should be 6: [4, -1, 2, 1]
// Easy case is when the list is made up of only positive numbers and the maximum sum is the sum of the whole array. If the list is made up of only negative numbers, return 0 instead.

// Empty list is considered to have zero greatest sum. Note that the empty list or array is also a valid sublist/subarray.

// Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

// It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b.

// array_diff([1,2],[1]) == [2]
// If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

// array_diff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]
