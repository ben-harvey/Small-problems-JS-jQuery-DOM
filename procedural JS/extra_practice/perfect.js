// The Greek mathematician Nicomachus devised a classification scheme for natural numbers, identifying each as belonging uniquely to the categories of abundant, perfect, or deficient. A perfect number equals the sum of its positive divisors â€” the pairs of numbers whose product yields the target number, excluding the number itself. This sum is known as the Aliquot sum.

// Perfect: Sum of factors = number
// Abundant: Sum of factors > number
// Deficient: Sum of factors < number
// Examples:

// 6 is a perfect number because its divisors are 1, 2, 3 and 6 = 1 + 2 + 3.
// 28 is a perfect number because 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14.
// Prime numbers 7, 13, etc are deficient by the Nicomachus classification.
// Write a program that can tell if a number is perfect, abundant or deficient.

/*
input: a number
output: a string classifying that number
rules:
  to classify a number:
    find its factors
    sum them
    if sum === number, perfect
    if sum > number, abundant
    if sum < number, deficient
  no bad input (numbers <= 1, decimals)

  divisors don't include the number itself

data structure:
  array of numbers
    for reduce to sum
algorithm:
  find divisors of number
    from 1 to number - 1, check if number % divisor === 0
    if so, push to divisors array
  sum those
  return a string based on comparing sum to number
